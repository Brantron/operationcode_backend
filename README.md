## Postmortem Reports

<details>

<summary>Click to expand </summary>


As incidents happen that require a great deal of troubleshooting and reveal a certain lack of domain knowledge, we wish to document these issues in way that can be used for contributors to learn. When such an event happens and a Root Cause Analysis is performed these issues will be added here.

For the purpose of security we need to ensure that no data is added to AAR that would compromise any operation code asset. These reports are intended to document issues and reasoning for future contributors and assist future investigations. In these reports we keep the details blameless and focus on how we can improve and iterate in a better manner.
